# Question 1: Create a method called 'square' which takes a parameter `x` and squares it
def square (x)
	x * x
end

# Question 2: Create a method called 'to_bool', which takes a string parameter called `questionable_string` and if the text of the string is 'true' then return true, else return false.
def to_bool
	if text == "questionable_string"
		puts "true"
	else
		puts "false"
end

# Question 3. Create a method called `is_prime`, which calculates if an input parameter `x` is prime, and return true or false. Just brute force this and don't try to be too smart about it.
def is_prime
	if x == "prime"
		puts "haha oh man i don't know, this is totally wrong"
	else
		whoops
	end
